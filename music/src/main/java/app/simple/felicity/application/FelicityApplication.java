     * content:// URI like "content://com.android.externalstorage...". The two
     * formats are completely incompatible, so an old database would just show
     * the user a library full of missing tracks on every launch — not great.
     * <p>
     * We solve this by deleting the whole database once, right here on first
     * launch of the new build. The scanner will repopulate everything using
     * the SAF URIs the user has already granted. After this one-time wipe the
     * flag is set and the database is never touched here again.
