/**
 * Manages the "Scanning Library" notification that pops up while Felicity
 * indexes your music collection. Keeping this separate from the loader itself
 * means the scanning logic stays focused on scanning, not on notification plumbing.
 *
 * The notification starts life as an indeterminate spinner (we don't know how
 * many songs there are yet), then graduates to a real progress bar once we
 * have counted all the audio files on the device.
 *
 * There is also a subtle race-condition guard built in using a "generation"
 * counter. If a scan is canceled and a new one starts immediately, the old
 * scan's cleanup cannot accidentally dismiss the new scan's notification —
 * because the generation number will have already moved on.
